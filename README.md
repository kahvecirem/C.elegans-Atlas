# C.elegans-Atlas

The use of C. elegans as a model organism in human-oriented studies is of great importance. Caenorhabditis elegans is a useful model organism for studying a variety of diseases ranging from SMA disease to mitochondrial diseases. It contributes to science in the analysis of data obtained in image processing research. R Shiny package, which is a kind of open software and increasingly used in data science, is a powerful tool that enables to create interactive web applications directly from R with results in various research fields such as genetics, engineering, bioinformatics. In this study, the main goal is to create an open-source website for the C. elegans images obtained with a confocal microscope and the C. elegans anatomy manually drawn in R Shiny well-done application.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88370259/215464266-e1a72ff6-6a26-43f8-8744-308c52bf6fad.png)

Aim: C.elegans Atlas is an open source-based project that aims to show the 3D anatomy of C. elegans, along with cilia movements, genes in comparison with equivalent variants in humans and C. elegans, using R Shiny, basically using confocal-based imaging and R programming.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88370259/215464335-cfd41771-05d0-4b8f-9e74-542705bcd69f.png)
